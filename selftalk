### Summary of the Article
Career success is heavily influenced by our inner self-talk, which can either advance or hinder our professional growth. We possess two types of self-talk: the emotional brain's reflexive and often negative voice, and the thinking brain's reflective and positive voice. The emotional brain can lead to anxiety and self-sabotage, while the thinking brain, which operates from the prefrontal cortex, promotes self-regulation, calm, and clarity, essential for career success.
High-performance self-talk is a critical component for managing stress, responding to setbacks, and improving overall job performance. Research shows that using third-person language in self-talk, instead of first-person pronouns, helps to reduce anxiety and improve performance. For instance, participants who used their names rather than "I" when preparing for a speech experienced less anxiety and performed better.
Experts like Dr. Ethan Kross and Dr. Richard Schwartz suggest that self-distancing through third-person self-talk enhances self-regulation and prevents emotional hijacking. This technique allows individuals to manage their reactions more effectively by viewing their emotions from a detached perspective.
Neuroscientists have found that this form of self-talk promotes self-control, reduces impulsivity, and enhances decision-making, even in stressful situations. Studies have also shown that using third-person language can help dieters make healthier choices and improve emotional regulation when faced with disturbing images.
By adopting high-performance self-talk, professionals can cultivate a narrative that promotes calm, confidence, and competence, ultimately leading to greater career success.

### Examples to Boost Productivity for High Performance
1. **Use Third-Person Self-Talk**: When facing a challenging task, address yourself by name instead of "I". For example, "John, you can handle this presentation" helps create a sense of distance and reduces anxiety.
2. **Positive Affirmations**: Start your day with positive affirmations using your name. For instance, "Sarah, you have the skills to succeed in today's meeting" can boost your confidence and set a positive tone for the day.
3. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Incorporate mindfulness practices to calm the emotional brain and strengthen the thinking brain. Regular meditation can enhance focus, reduce stress, and improve emotional regulation.
4. **Set Clear Goals**: Break down your tasks into clear, manageable goals. Use self-talk to remind yourself of these goals, such as "David, your goal is to complete the first draft by noon."
5. **Reflective Journaling**: Spend a few minutes each day reflecting on your experiences and writing them down in the third person. For example, "Anna felt proud of her team's progress today" helps reinforce positive experiences and learning from setbacks.
By implementing these strategies, professionals can harness the power of high-performance self-talk to enhance productivity and achieve greater success in their careers.
